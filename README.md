# Local Voice Agent

A fully local, privacy-first AI voice agent for Apple Silicon. No cloud APIs, no
recurring cost, no data leaving the machine.

## Constraints

1. **Permissive licenses only** — Apache-2.0, MIT, BSD. Enforced in code by
   `src/voiceagent/models.py` and checked by the diagnostic below.
2. **Memory budget** — the resident pipeline stays under 12 GiB on an 18 GiB
   M3 Pro, leaving ≥4 GiB for macOS.
3. **Zero recurring cost** — local inference only.
4. **Modular** — STT, LLM, TTS, and tools each sit behind an interface in
   `<module>/base.py` and can be swapped independently.

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
uv run voice-doctor
```

`voice-doctor` reports RAM, Metal/MLX status, the license audit, and the memory
budget table. It exits non-zero if any constraint is violated.

## Layout

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `stt/` | Speech-to-text backends (Phase 1) |
| `llm/` | Local LLM + tool calling (Phase 2) |
| `tts/` | Speech synthesis (Phase 3) |
| `orchestration/` | Pipecat pipeline, VAD, barge-in (Phase 4) |
| `tools/` | Tool registry and implementations (Phase 5) |
| `storage/` | Encrypted history and memory (Phase 6) |
| `voice_clone/` | Consent-gated voice cloning (Phase 7) |
| `diagnostics/` | Environment and budget checks (Phase 0) |
| `models.py` | Model registry, licenses, memory budget |

## Phase status

- [x] **Phase 0** — environment and memory audit
- [ ] Phase 1 — STT standalone
- [ ] Phase 2 — LLM brain standalone
- [ ] Phase 3 — TTS standalone
- [ ] Phase 4 — full voice loop (Pipecat)
- [ ] Phase 5 — tool layer
- [ ] Phase 6 — local memory and storage
- [ ] Phase 7 — voice cloning (optional, consent-gated)
- [ ] Phase 8 — Tauri packaging

## Rejected models

These are non-commercial and must not be reintroduced (see `DENYLIST` in
`models.py`):

- **XTTS v2** — CPML, non-commercial.
- **F5-TTS** — trained on Emilia (CC-BY-NC-4.0).
- **Fish Speech** — weights are CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0.
